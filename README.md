## Csv Files

The csv files are in a 'csv' folder
The test file being too big to be put on github, we should have it locally on our machine, under the folder 'script/csv' of the project. It has been added to the gitignore

## *.py Files

all the python files are now in a 'Methods' folder, please put all your future python files in this folder. For the import, you should now do "from Methods.[name_of_your_file].py import *"
